<h3> Every Kid Deserves an Education </h3>

    World hunger and lack of water are very important issues to me. I still can not believe that our society has let people suffer this long without doing something about it. I also think that lack of education is a big problem. As well as having a lack of health care. I feel very passionate about everybody having access to food and water because everybody deserves to go a day without being hungry or having to walk miles just to get a sip of water. I recently finished reading the book, I am Malala. Her story really brought me into the reality of what is going on in some places in the world with kidsâ€™ education. I think that every child should get the chance at an education no matter their gender or financial status. I think that every person should have a chance to live, and sometimes they do not get that chance due to a lack of health care.

    I find it really sad when someone loses their life due to not having enough money or resources to get the right health care. I desperately want to change that. I want to make sure that every child has access to food and water because at the very least that is what they deserve. I also want kids to be able to have an education. I think that is the root of the problem because a good education leads to a good job, which leads to being able to afford food water and health care. I also want to make sure that everybody that needs it has access to medicine. I want to become a teacher and go to places where kids do not have access to education. I encourage not only teachers but doctors too, to go to places in need. Instead of staying here where we have plenty of doctors and teachers. A smaller thing that you could do is donate and support food banks and water organizations, like <i>Water for South Sudan</i> and the <i>Malala Fund</i>.
